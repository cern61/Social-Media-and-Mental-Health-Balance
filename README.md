1. Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between social media usage habits and mental health indicators using data science techniques. An open-source dataset was analyzed through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization methods. The findings suggest that the duration and intensity of social media usage may be associated with variations in certain mental health indicators. The results highlight the importance of maintaining balanced social media usage for psychological well-being.

2. Introduction

In recent years, the widespread use of social media platforms has raised concerns about their potential impact on mental health. Understanding how social media usage patterns relate to psychological well-being has become an important research topic. The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between social media usage and mental health indicators using data analysis techniques. This study aims to provide data-driven insights into how social media habits may influence stress levels, emotional well-being, and overall mental health.

3. Dataset Description

The Mental Health and Social Media Balance Dataset was used in this project. The dataset contains information related to individuals’:

Daily social media usage duration

Frequency of social media platform usage

Self-reported mental health and well-being indicators

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and is suitable for academic and educational purposes.

4. Methodology

The project was conducted following the steps outlined below:

Data Loading: The dataset was imported into the Python environment.

Data Preprocessing: Missing values were examined and appropriate data cleaning procedures were applied.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries and visualizations were used to explore patterns within the data.

Data Visualization: Relationships between social media usage variables and mental health indicators were visualized using charts and graphs.

5. Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were utilized in this project:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

Version Control: Git and GitHub

6. Results and Discussion

The analysis results indicate that increased social media usage may be associated with negative changes in certain mental health indicators. However, it is important to note that these findings do not imply a direct causal relationship. Individual differences and external factors may influence the observed outcomes. The results emphasize the importance of balanced and mindful social media usage.

7. Conclusion

This study examined the relationship between social media usage habits and mental health from a data science perspective. The findings suggest that social media usage patterns may be related to psychological well-being. Future work may include the use of larger datasets and the application of machine learning models to achieve more comprehensive and predictive analyses.
